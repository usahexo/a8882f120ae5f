#  Who designs the stickers? 

There are a lot of different stickers in the world. Some people might think that anyone can design a sticker, but this is not the case. In order to make a good sticker, you need to have some design skills.

Most of the time, professional graphic designers are the ones who create stickers. They know how to make them look good and attract attention. This is why if you want to create a good sticker, you need to hire a professional designer.

There are many different graphic design programs out there, and each one can be used to create unique stickers. However, Adobe Photoshop is often considered to be the best program for this type of work.

If you want to learn how to use Photoshop, there are many different tutorials online that can help you get started. Once you have learned the basics, you will be able to create your own custom stickers that stand out from the rest.

#  Where do the stickers come from? 

Stickers are a fun way to share messages with friends and family, or to show off your personality. They come in all shapes and sizes, and can be used for a variety of purposes. But where do they come from?

Most stickers are made from paper, vinyl, or cloth. The production process begins by printing the design onto one of these materials. The sticker is then cut out using a rotary cutter or scissors, leaving a thin border around the edge.

The final step is to apply an adhesive to the back of the sticker. This can be done using a roller or a sheet of adhesive that is placed over the top of the sticker. Once it is in place, the sticker can be attached to any surface.

There are also temporary stickers that can be removed without leaving any residue behind. These are made from a special type of paper that is coated with an adhesive on one side. When it is applied to a surface, the adhesive will stick to it and hold the sticker in place. But when it is peeled off, the adhesive will release its grip and the sticker will come off cleanly.
